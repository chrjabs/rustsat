abstract="This paper develops techniques for efficiently detecting redundancies in CNF formulas. We introduce the concept of hidden literals, resulting in the novel technique of hidden literal elimination. We develop a practical simplification algorithm that enables ``Unhiding'' various redundancies in a unified framework. Based on time stamping literals in the binary implication graph, the algorithm applies various binary clause based simplifications, including techniques that, when run repeatedly until fixpoint, can be too costly. Unhiding can also be applied during search, taking learnt clauses into account. We show that Unhiding gives performance improvements on real-world SAT competition benchmarks.",

abstract="Stochastic Local Search (SLS) solvers are considered one of the best solving technique for randomly generated problems and more recently also have shown great promise for several types of hard combinatorial problems. Within this work, we provide a thorough analysis of different implementation variants of SLS solvers on random and on hard combinatorial problems. By analyzing existing SLS implementations, we are able to discover new improvements inspired by CDCL solvers, which can speed up the search of all types of SLS solvers. Further, our analysis reveals that the multilevel break values of variables can be easily computed and used within the decision heuristic. By augmenting the probSAT solver with the new heuristic, we are able to reach new state-of-the-art performance on several types of SAT problems, especially on those with long clauses. We further provide a detailed analysis of the clause selection policy used in focused search SLS solvers.",

abstract="We present a novel preprocessing technique to automatically reduce the size of Boolean formulas. This technique, called Bounded Variable Addition (BVA), exchanges clauses for variables. Similar to other preprocessing techniques, BVA greedily lowers the sum of variables and clauses, a rough measure for the hardness to solve a formula. We show that cardinality constraints (CCs) can efficiently be reencoded: from a naive CC encoding, BVA automatically generates a compact encoding, which is smaller than sophisticated encodings. Experimental results show that applying BVA can improve SAT solving performance.",

abstract="An effective SAT preprocessing technique is the construction of symmetry breaking formulas: auxiliary clauses that guide a SAT solver away from needless exploration of symmetric subproblems. However, during the past decade, state-of-the-art SAT solvers rarely incorporated symmetry breaking. This suggests that the reduction of the search space does not outweigh the overhead incurred by detecting symmetry and constructing symmetry breaking formulas. We investigate three methods to construct more effective symmetry breaking formulas. The first method simply improves the encoding of symmetry breaking formulas. The second detects special symmetry subgroups, for which complete symmetry breaking formulas exist. The third infers binary symmetry breaking clauses for a symmetry group as a whole rather than longer clauses for individual symmetries. We implement these methods in a symmetry breaking preprocessor, and verify their effectiveness on both hand-picked problems as well as the 2014 SAT competition benchmark set. Our experiments indicate that our symmetry breaking preprocessor improves the current state-of-the-art in static symmetry breaking for SAT and has a sufficiently low overhead to improve the performance of modern SAT solvers on hard combinatorial instances.",
