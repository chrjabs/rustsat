# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## 0.2.2 - 2025-10-18

**NOTE**: the feature `all` has been renamed to `_test`.
This is _not_ treated as a breaking change, because it was always intended as an internal feature.
The leading underscore now properly marks the feature as internal.

### Miscellaneous Tasks

- Include keep-sorted formatter ([46e505c](46e505cca3e50b7743c47288b2fb2610da3f1952))
