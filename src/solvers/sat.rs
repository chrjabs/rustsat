//! # Interface to SAT Solvers
//!
//! This module holds traits and types defining the interface to SAT solvers.
//! The API follows the [typestate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typestate_analysis) pattern,
//! meaning that state transitions are encoded into Rust's typesystem, which makes calls in invalid
//! stats (e.g., attempting to obtain a solution from a solver in the UNSAT state) impossible.
//!
//! ## Non-Incremental Solving
//!
//! Non-incremental or single-shot solving is the process where, for given formula, the SAT solver
//! determines whether a solution exists or not.
//! Afterwards, the solver can not be used further.
//!
//! Non-incremental solving is modeled via the [`Solve`] trait, which defines a type for the solver
//! in each state.
//! The state diagram with possible transitions looks as follows:
//! ```txt
//! ┌──────┐   ┌───────┐      ┌─────┐    
//! │ Init ├──►│ Input ├─┬───►│ Sat │    
//! └──────┘   └───────┘ │    └─────┘    
//!                      │    ┌───────┐  
//!                      ├───►│ Unsat │  
//!                      │    └───────┘  
//!                      │    ┌─────────┐
//!                      └───►│ Unknown │
//!                           └─────────┘
//! ```
//! Most states have a corresponding trait in this module, that defines which operations are valid
//! in this state.
//! - [`Init`]: The initialization state of the solver where no clauses are added yet, but certain
//!   options can that can not be altered after the first clause has been added, can be set
//! - [`Input`]: The state in which clauses are added
//! - [`Sat`]: A solution to the input formula has been found
//! - `Unsat`: The formula has been determined to not have a solution
//! - `Unknown`: The search has been terminated early
//!
//! ## Incremental Solving
//!
//! In incremental solving, additional clauses can be added to the SAT solver after previous solve
//! calls, and the instance can be resolved.
//! Additionally, so-called _assumptions_ can be set for a solve call, which is a partial
//! assignment that the solver is supposed to extend.
//! If the solver determines that a set of assumptions cannot be extended to a solution, the solver
//! can provide a so-called _core_, a clause over the variables in the assumptions that is implied
//! by the formula.
//!
//! Incremental solving is captured by the [`SolveIncremental`] trait.
//! The state diagram for incremental solving looks as follews:
//!
//! ```txt
//! ┌──────┐   ┌───────┐      ┌─────┐       
//! │ Init ├──►│ Input ├─┬───►│ Sat ├──────┐
//! └──────┘   └───────┘ │    └─────┘      │
//!                ▲     │    ┌───────┐    │
//!                │     ├───►│ Unsat ├────┤
//!                │     │    └───────┘    │
//!                │     │    ┌─────────┐  │
//!                │     └───►│ Unknown ├──┤
//!                │          └─────────┘  │
//!                └───────────────────────┘
//! ```
//!
//! ## Available Solvers

//! Interfaces to concrete solvers are available through separate crates, where the traits defined
//! in this module (e.g., [`Solve`]) are implemented.
