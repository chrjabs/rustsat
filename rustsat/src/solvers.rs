//! # Interfaces to SAT Solvers
//!
//! This module holds types and functions regarding SAT solvers. The main
//! element is the [`Solve`] trait that every SAT solver in this library
//! implements.
//!
//! ## Available Solvers
//!
//! Solvers are available through separate crates.
//!
//! ### CaDiCaL
//!
//! [CaDiCaL](https://github.com/arminbiere/cadical) is a fully incremental SAT
//! solver by Armin Biere implemented in C++. It includes incremental
//! inprocessing. It is available through the
//! [`rustsat-cadical`](https://crates.io/crates/rustsat-cadical) crate.
