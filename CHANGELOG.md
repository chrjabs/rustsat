## [0.5.1] - 2024-06-12

### Features

- Incremental precision in DPW
- Format vars and lits nicely with debug

### Bug Fixes

- Make `Node` type (of `dbtotalizer`) opaque. This is technically a breaking
  change, but since the `Node` type was never intended to be transparent, we are
  _not_ treating it as one. If you are relying on having access to the `Node`
  type, use the feature `internal` instead, but note that the internal API is
  unstable.

### Testing

- Fix warnings
